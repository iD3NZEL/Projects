This project consists of two interdependent Arduino sketches that control different parts of the machine. Both need to be uploaded and running simultaneously for the system to work correctly:

Keypad + LCD + Tray Logic

Motor Control + Sensor Feedback

Together, they enable users to select paper trays, enter folding counts, and trigger motor-driven dispensing
